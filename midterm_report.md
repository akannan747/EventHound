### This report should in detail explain your Minimum Viable Project (baseline solution) and it should include an evaluation of how well your solution performs on the problem you're trying to solve. The report should clearly outline the progress you have made so far, as well as the challenges you are currently facing.

### Also include a link to your Github repository where you have all the code base that you have produced in your project. 

 

### Here are a few things you should include and explain in your report

### 1. Datasets you're using: Eventbrite and Ticketmaster
### 2. Data analysis / EDA results: Expected outcome: Based on user query and the descriptions of the events, we hope to provide a top five list of events that the user would be interested in. Events considered would be within a five mile radius of the target location as well as within the requested time frame or within a month of the search. 
### 3. Baseline models that are trained on your data you have (this might not be the best model, but should give you an idea about the next steps)
### 4. A link to a working prototype of your full system, preferably with an interactive UI (with backend and frontend connected). Note, this might not be the final version or have all the functionalities - include screenshots or a link to a video of a screen recording where you walk through the system
### 5. Performance evaluation. Answer the question: "Are you currently satisfied with your system's performance". Why / why not?)
### 6. System Architecture Overview (in detail) -- if it's a system where a user interacts also outline the UX interaction flow + Code snippets to explain certain parts of the work done
### 8. Key findings
### 9. Bottlenecks / challenges
